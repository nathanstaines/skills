# Diagnosing bugs

A discipline for hard bugs. Skip phases only when explicitly justified.

When exploring the codebase, build a clear mental model of the relevant modules using the project's domain glossary, and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching (see `docs/agents/domain.md`).

## Phase 1: build a feedback loop

**This is the skill.** Everything else is mechanical. If you have a **tight** pass/fail signal for the bug, one that goes red on _this_ bug, you will find the cause; bisection, hypothesis-testing and instrumentation all just consume it. If you don't have one, no amount of staring at code will save you.

Spend disproportionate effort here. **Be aggressive. Be creative. Refuse to give up.**

Which loop to reach for first follows the project's `### Testing` stance in the Agent skills block (if the stance is missing, re-run `/setup-skills`). Where the project tests, a failing test at the right seam (`/codebase-design` owns the seam vocabulary) is the natural first loop. Where it's test-free, skip past the test and go straight to a script, harness or replay loop. The stance decides; the order below is only a default.

### Ways to construct one, in roughly this order

1. **Failing test** at whatever seam reaches the bug: unit, integration or e2e.
2. **Curl / HTTP script** against a running dev server.
3. **CLI invocation** with a fixture input, diffing stdout against a known-good snapshot.
4. **Headless browser script** (Playwright / Puppeteer): drives the UI, asserts on DOM/console/network.
5. **Replay a captured trace.** Save a real network request / payload / event log to disk; replay it through the code path in isolation.
6. **Throwaway harness.** Spin up a minimal subset of the system (one service, mocked deps) that exercises the bug code path with a single function call.
7. **Property / fuzz loop.** If the bug is "sometimes wrong output", run 1000 random inputs and look for the failure mode.
8. **Bisection harness.** If the bug appeared between two known states (a revision, a dataset, a version), automate "boot at state X, check, repeat" so the bisection runs mechanically (`git bisect run` where the project uses git).
9. **Differential loop.** Run the same input through old-version vs new-version (or two configs) and diff outputs.
10. **HITL bash script.** Last resort. If a human must click, drive _them_ with `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh` so the loop is still structured. Captured output feeds back to you.

### Tighten the loop

Treat the loop as a product. Once you have _a_ loop, **tighten** it:

- Can I make it faster? (Cache setup, skip unrelated init, narrow the test scope.)
- Can I make the signal sharper? (Assert on the specific symptom, not "didn't crash".)
- Can I make it more deterministic? (Pin time, seed RNG, isolate filesystem, freeze network.)

A 30-second flaky loop is barely better than no loop; a 2-second deterministic one is tight, a debugging superpower.

### Non-deterministic bugs

The goal is not a clean repro but a **higher reproduction rate**. Loop the trigger 100×, parallelise, add stress, narrow timing windows, inject sleeps. A 50%-flake bug is debuggable; 1% is not, so keep raising the rate until it's debuggable.

### When you genuinely cannot build a loop

Stop and say so explicitly. List what you tried. Ask the user for: (a) access to whatever environment reproduces it, (b) a captured artefact (HAR file, log dump, core dump, screen recording with timestamps) or (c) permission to add temporary production instrumentation. Do **not** proceed to hypothesise without a loop.

### Completion criterion: a tight loop that goes red

Phase 1 is done when the loop is **tight** and **red-capable**: you can name **one command**, a script path, a test invocation or a curl, that you have **already run at least once** (paste the invocation and its output), and that is:

- [ ] **Red-capable**: it drives the actual bug code path and asserts the **user's exact symptom**, so it can go red on this bug and green once fixed. Not "runs without erroring"; it must be able to _catch this specific bug_.
- [ ] **Deterministic**: same verdict every run (flaky bugs: a pinned, high reproduction rate, per above).
- [ ] **Fast**: seconds, not minutes.
- [ ] **Agent-runnable**: you can run it unattended; a human in the loop only via `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh`.

If you catch yourself reading code to build a theory before this command exists, **stop; jumping straight to a hypothesis is the exact failure this skill prevents.** No red-capable command, no Phase 2.

## Phase 2: reproduce + minimise

Run the loop. Watch it go red: the bug appears.

Confirm:

- [ ] The loop produces the failure mode the **user** described, not a different failure that happens to be nearby. Wrong bug = wrong fix.
- [ ] The failure is reproducible across multiple runs (or, for non-deterministic bugs, reproducible at a high enough rate to debug against).
- [ ] You have captured the exact symptom (error message, wrong output, slow timing) so later phases can verify the fix actually addresses it.

### Minimise

Once it's red, shrink the repro to the **smallest scenario that still goes red**. Cut inputs, callers, config, data and steps **one at a time**, re-running the loop after each cut; keep only what's load-bearing for the failure.

Why bother: a minimal repro shrinks the hypothesis space in Phase 3 (fewer moving parts left to suspect) and becomes the clean regression guard in Phase 5.

Done when **every remaining element is load-bearing**: removing any one of them makes the loop go green.

Do not proceed until you have reproduced **and** minimised.

## Phase 3: hypothesise

Generate **3–5 ranked hypotheses** before testing any of them. Single-hypothesis generation anchors on the first plausible idea.

Each hypothesis must be **falsifiable**: state the prediction it makes.

> Format: "If <X> is the cause, then <changing Y> will make the bug disappear / <changing Z> will make it worse."

If you cannot state the prediction, the hypothesis is a vibe; discard or sharpen it.

**Show the ranked list to the user before testing.** They often have domain knowledge that re-ranks instantly ("we just deployed a change to #3"), or know hypotheses they've already ruled out. Cheap checkpoint, big time saver. Don't block on it; proceed with your ranking if the user is AFK.

## Phase 4: instrument

Each probe must map to a specific prediction from Phase 3. **Change one variable at a time.**

Tool preference:

1. **Debugger / REPL inspection** if the env supports it. One breakpoint beats ten logs.
2. **Targeted logs** at the points that distinguish hypotheses.
3. Never "log everything and grep".

**Tag every debug log** with a unique prefix, e.g. `[DEBUG-a4f2]`. Cleanup at the end becomes a single grep. Untagged logs survive; tagged logs die.

**Perf branch.** For performance regressions, logs are usually wrong. Instead: establish a baseline measurement (timing harness, `performance.now()`, profiler, query plan), then bisect. Measure first, fix second.

## Phase 5: fix + regression guard

Whether this phase writes a test comes from the project's `### Testing` stance.

**Where the project tests:** write the regression test **before** the fix, but only if a **correct seam** exists. A correct seam is one where the test exercises the **real bug pattern** as it occurs at the call site. If the only available seam is too shallow (a single-caller test when the bug needs multiple callers, a unit test that can't replicate the chain that triggered the bug), a test there gives false confidence.

**Where the project is test-free:** the regression guard is the minimised repro itself, saved as a runnable script or fixture beside the code rather than a suite test. The same judgement applies: the guard must assert the real bug pattern at the call site, not a shallow proxy.

**If no correct seam exists, that itself is the finding.** Note it. The codebase architecture is preventing the bug from being locked down. Flag this for the next phase.

Once a seam (or a saved-guard location) exists:

1. Turn the minimised repro into a red guard at that seam: a failing test, or a script that exits non-zero on the bug.
2. Watch it fail.
3. Apply the fix.
4. Watch it pass.
5. Re-run the Phase 1 feedback loop against the original (un-minimised) scenario.

## Phase 6: cleanup + post-mortem

Required before declaring done:

- [ ] Original repro no longer reproduces (re-run the Phase 1 loop)
- [ ] Regression guard passes: the test, or the saved repro script where the project is test-free (or absence of a correct seam is documented)
- [ ] All `[DEBUG-...]` instrumentation removed (`grep` the prefix)
- [ ] Throwaway prototypes deleted (or moved to a clearly-marked debug location)
- [ ] The hypothesis that turned out correct is stated in the change description (commit, changeset or PR), so the next debugger learns

**Then ask: what would have prevented this bug?** If the answer involves architectural change (no good seam, tangled callers, hidden coupling), recommend `/architecture-review` with the specifics. Make the recommendation **after** the fix is in, not before; you have more information now than when you started.
