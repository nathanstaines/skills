# Design it twice

When the user wants to explore alternative interfaces for a chosen deepening candidate, use this parallel sub-agent pattern. Based on "design it twice" (Ousterhout): your first idea is unlikely to be the best.

Uses the vocabulary in [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md): **module**, **interface**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**.

## Process

### 1. Frame the problem space

Before spawning sub-agents, write a user-facing explanation of the problem space for the chosen candidate:

- The constraints any new interface would need to satisfy
- The dependencies it would rely on and which category they fall into (see [DEEPENING.md](./DEEPENING.md))
- A rough illustrative sketch to ground the constraints; not a proposal, just a way to make the constraints concrete

Show this to the user, then immediately proceed to step 2. The user reads and thinks while the sub-agents work in parallel.

### 2. Spawn sub-agents

Spawn three or more sub-agents in parallel using the Agent tool. Each must produce a **radically different** interface for the deepened module.

Prompt each sub-agent with a separate technical brief (file paths, coupling details, dependency category from [DEEPENING.md](./DEEPENING.md), what sits behind the seam). The brief is independent of the user-facing problem-space explanation in step 1. Give each agent a different design constraint:

- Agent 1: "Minimise the interface; aim for one to three entry points at most. Maximise leverage per entry point."
- Agent 2: "Maximise flexibility; support many use cases and extension."
- Agent 3: "Optimise for the most common caller; make the default case trivial."
- Agent 4 (when the dependency category calls for it): "Design around ports and adapters for cross-seam dependencies."

What "radically different" means follows the substance. Imperative designs differ in entry points and dependency strategy; declarative designs differ in where the seam sits (mixin parameters, a custom-property contract, utility classes).

Include both the [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) vocabulary and the project's domain glossary (see `docs/agents/domain.md`) in the brief so each sub-agent names things consistently with the architecture language and the domain language.

Each sub-agent outputs:

1. The interface: entry points and parameters, plus invariants, ordering constraints and error modes
2. A usage example showing how callers use it
3. What the implementation hides behind the seam
4. The dependency strategy and adapters (see [DEEPENING.md](./DEEPENING.md))
5. Trade-offs: where leverage is high, where it's thin

### 3. Present and compare

Present designs sequentially so the user can absorb each one, then compare them in prose. Contrast by **depth** (leverage at the interface), **locality** (where change concentrates) and **seam placement**.

After comparing, give your own recommendation: which design is strongest and why. If elements from different designs would combine well, propose a hybrid. Be opinionated; the user wants a strong read, not a menu.
